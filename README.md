# shadowcatzero's neovim config

uhhh hi, welcome to my home grown neovim config :)

I have no idea if I'm doing things right, but I try to keep it structurally clean and up to date with well written plugins

I try to only add plugins that I will use so it's somewhat minimal but it does everything I want

I would put details here, but I'm too lazy to update this readme, and this is mostly just for syncing my config / sharing with friends

I might add keybind documentation in the future in case someone actually wants to try using this, or I wanna introduce someone to neovim
